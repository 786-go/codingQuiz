# codingQuiz

## Description
This app was created primarily to put my JS skills to the test and to use. I learned a great deal of JS through the implementation of this app and it has reinforced my understanding of the relationship between JS, html, and css. It was exciting to manipulate the html and css through JS. I also learned how a project should be viewed through the lens of a JS developer,
ie, when to create variables/functions, when to split a function into 2 separate functions, etc. I will certainly be using this as a template for future designs of quizzes/questionaires as I am quite proud of this accomplishment. 

## Creators
The people responsible for creating this app were me and my tutor, Sangeetha Kaliaperumal, whose help and advice was of tremendous aid in this project.
